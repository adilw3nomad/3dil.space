   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;disclaimer: I have strong opinions that I hold rather loosely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be frank; I don‚Äôt like the word ‚ÄòCulture‚Äô. Or at least its usage in the context of the tech industry. Its ambiguity is routinely abused by companies seeking to entice naive employees into their grasp. Sometimes they even have the gall to list &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; under their ‚ÄòBenefits and Compensation‚Äô section! As if a good and healthy working environment is an added benefit, rather than a given in any modern place of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;work culture&lt;/em&gt; exactly? Some would have you believe that it consists of free coffee, a table tennis table, a beer fridge, and a biweekly day for you to ‚Äòwork on personal projects‚Äô. I‚Äôm not going to say these are bad things, but they do not define a &lt;em&gt;work culture&lt;/em&gt;. They are tangentially related to my personal definition of work culture, compromised of the three &lt;strong&gt;Cs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communication&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Camaraderie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stuff I mentioned above, the stereotypical things you might find in an office, or a job description, are &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to facilitate one of these three Cs in one form or another. However, their presence does not imply a good work culture, nor does their absence imply a bad one; they are simply tools whose effectiveness depends on how they are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will focus on &lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt;, and I will tackle the next two Cs in separate posts. I must stress that these are only my own thoughts on the subject, and I welcome any challenges or alternate opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of the Cs, and arguably the foundation upon which the other two reside, is communication; how do colleagues communicate with each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every group of people, a secondary form of &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; develops from the conversations and interactions that occur during the process of ‚Äúwork‚Äù. The longer a group of people interacts with each other, the more entrenched this &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; becomes. It influences every debate, meeting, and crucially, &lt;strong&gt;decision&lt;/strong&gt; that takes place within the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, therefore, of immense importance that the development of this &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; is carefully observed and pruned in order to have the qualities of inclusivity, honesty, and freedom. If these qualities are present, then conversations are more likely to have a diverse range of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; ideas. &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt; ideas are quickly torn apart, as the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; promotes honesty and the freedom to express that honesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWell, that all sounds great Adil, but how on earth do we develop a &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt;, when we‚Äôre up to our neck simply developing our app?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair point, my imaginary stressed out founder. As is often the case in start ups, there is a tremendous amount of focus on delivering; ideas must be validated, and validation comes from putting forth an MVP (the minimum viable product). For the sake of the MVP, many things are placed in the backlog; actions that are unequivocally vital for the &lt;em&gt;continued&lt;/em&gt; success of any idea. Automated testing is eschewed in favour of manual QA, code is left inefficient and not performant, favouring paying out a larger infrastructure bill &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;as long as the MVP works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some form of debt, technical or otherwise, is taken on willingly; a sacrifice for the MVP, the master of startup destinies. However, cultural debt is not as easily paid off; it‚Äôs a lot easier to write an automated test then it is to change something as fluid and intangible as the way people communicate. Social norms tend to have a compounding effect as you add more people to the group; new joiners want to fit in, so they tend to behave in the same fashion as their colleagues. While it‚Äôs not impossible to change this, it‚Äôs an incredibly complex endeavour due to the nature of the problem; humans are unpredictable and normally averse to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt; is the master of a startup‚Äôs destiny, &lt;strong&gt;Culture&lt;/strong&gt; controls it‚Äôs continued success; it‚Äôs effect on productivity, recruiting and &lt;strong&gt;retention&lt;/strong&gt; of talent, and &lt;strong&gt;promotion of innovative ideas&lt;/strong&gt; is practically undeniable. (I would add links to research papers that prove this, but I feel like if you‚Äôve read this far, we‚Äôre probably on the same page already. If we‚Äôre not; try duckduckgo-ing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&apos;effect of company culture at work research&apos;&lt;/code&gt; and see if that changes your mind üòâ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while it may be acceptable to make some technical compromises in order to deliver an &lt;em&gt;MVP&lt;/em&gt;, some minimal effort must be put towards creating a &lt;em&gt;minimum viable culture&lt;/em&gt;. I would call it an &lt;em&gt;MVC&lt;/em&gt;, but something tells me that acronym won‚Äôt catch on. Forget about the name for the time being, naming stuff is hard. Let‚Äôs just focus on what‚Äôs the minimum we can do in order to ensure the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; of our communication embodies the qualities of Inclusivity, Honesty, and Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deliver this &lt;em&gt;MVP language&lt;/em&gt; of communication, which will be the cornerstone of all communication within the company, and in turn the foundation of the company‚Äôs culture, we must take a slight detour to understand how our brains work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compassion&quot;&gt;Compassion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of interesting research about how humans evolved to be compassionate; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864937/&quot;&gt;one such paper&lt;/a&gt; posits a very interesting idea;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶is that individuals will favor enduring relationships with &lt;strong&gt;more agreeable, compassionate individuals&lt;/strong&gt; because this emotional trait predicts &lt;strong&gt;increased cooperative&lt;/strong&gt;, trustworthy behavior and &lt;strong&gt;mutually beneficial exchanges&lt;/strong&gt; among individuals not bound by kin relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I strongly recommend reading the entire paper, as the subject is quite nuanced, I strongly believe that promoting compassionate conversations has the affect of increasing trust. Trust is essential in any working environment, but never as important as when you are trying to foster &lt;strong&gt;Inclusivity, Honesty, Freedom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture a bunch of kids in a classroom; rambunctiously waiting for the shrill ringing of the morning bell that signifies the start of their lesson. Their teacher walks in, and behind the teacher is a slightly sheepish, meek young child who has just joined the school. The kid has no friends; he is an outsider, known to no one, and faces the difficult task of integrating themselves into the increasingly complicated social minefield that is high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the kids offers to show the newcomer around; and from that moment, the newcomer starts to develop a sense of trust with their ‚Äòguide‚Äô. The newcomer starts to feel &lt;strong&gt;included&lt;/strong&gt; when the invited eat lunch with the guides group of friends. With this sense of inclusion, the newcomer shyly joins a conversation about which Christopher Nolan flick is the best, giving an &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; opinion that *Inception** is the directors greatest work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;the newcomer is young so doesn‚Äôt know that Memento is objectively the best Nolan movie ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the guide vehemently disagrees with him, stating that &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt; is way better, the newcomer feels the &lt;strong&gt;Freedom&lt;/strong&gt; to disagree, and launches into a convoluted argument consisting of the lack of recognition of Leonardo DiCaprio, the ambigious ending, and the replayability of &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;**.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**again, Memento is objectively better in all regards. bloody gen z smh grumble grumble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now cinema aside, we can see that in this totally-made-up story, the compassion of the guide led to the newcomer feeling &lt;strong&gt;Included&lt;/strong&gt; in a discussion, where they could &lt;strong&gt;freely&lt;/strong&gt; express their &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; (if incorrect) opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can draw your own parallels between the above anecdote and similar experiences in the workplace. Build trust through compassion in your communication, and the fruits of your efforts will be an environment where everyone feels &lt;strong&gt;included&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to express their &lt;strong&gt;honest&lt;/strong&gt; opinions. There will always be conflict (no doubt those two kids argued about that subject for days), but as long as they communicate with compassion, this is likely to result in &lt;em&gt;healthy conflict&lt;/em&gt;, which is essential to any relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, to be alive is to be suffering. I know that sounds hyperbolic, but it‚Äôs true; we are all constantly suffering from something or the other, at varying degrees of severity. Compassion is recognising this, just as the guide recognised the newcomer was suffering from shyness.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hardest decision of my career</title>
   <link href="https://adilw3nomad.github.io//2022/04/25/hardest-decision-of-my-career/"/>
   <updated>2022-04-25T09:29:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>https://adilw3nomad.github.io/2022/04/25/hardest-decision-of-my-career</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-most-difficult-decision-of-my-career&quot;&gt;The most difficult decision of my career&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I resigned from my position as an engineer at one of the fastest unicorns in the industry; a company last valued at 7.4 billion dollars. A place that has revolutionised the outdated ideas we cling to about communication, offices, and the imaginary lines that define where and how we work. It‚Äôs a place that exists in cyberspace, (albeit not as cool as the one in Neuromancer), where I honed my craft and was applauded not only for my achievements, but for being authentically, unapologetically, me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made friends with people I had never met, and worked alongside them at breakneck speed, providing a service that was invaluable in bringing people closer together when it was most needed. Alongside some of the most brilliant minds in our industry, I was exposed to a cornucopia of new perspectives, new models of thinking, new ways of working, soaking it all up like a sponge in a fish tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My identity as an engineer is entwined with that of Hopin to a large extent, something I am both proud and grateful for. Like a mirror, it showed me aspects of my self I was unaware of, in particular my interests in the nature of collaboration, culture and compassion in the practice of software development.  The immense and rapid growth Hopin experienced, from 80 employees when I joined to 1000,  gave me a front seat view to study these things in ‚Äúproduction‚Äù so to speak, to tweak and adjust even the most minute details in my own pod, finding that much of the industry (as I have experienced it), ignore one of the most crucial aspects of a successful group, team, or company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by many at Hopin, I have found the courage to let go of what is safe and run head first into a new adventure; one where I can begin to share the things I‚Äôve learnt that work, and validate new ideas around how to effectively and easily help people scale their engineering teams. Unfortunately (well fortunately really), Hopin has matured to a point where I can‚Äôt have the type of impact which I desire; it has grown to be stable and laser focused, with a strongly defined culture that aligns with its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so with a heavy heart, I left the first job that I really, truly, deeply loved with every ounce of my being. The first place I felt I unequivocally belonged, where my voice was heard and respected, in order to chase a new challenge that has become a burning desire that consumes my thoughts constantly. I want to be as revolutionary as Johnny when he decided to go against the norm and make a fully remote company; I want to change the way the industry values qualities that are as essential as practical and technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that‚Äôs that; the hardest decision of my career, to leave a company that I love, where I felt like I belonged, in order to try and expose the true nature of ‚Äòculture‚Äô to the world of tech. I aim to continue to be an engineer, however to all recruiters; its 2022, please do not approach me with anything not fully remote. Let‚Äôs leave offices and daily commuting in the past where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written a short piece on the easiest decision of my career; joining Hopin, which will be followed by more personal moments that I feel demonstrate why the Hopin Rocketship is as fast as it is; (hint; it wasn‚Äôt just because of covid). I hope I can distill the essence of what it felt like to work at Hopin, and the how and why behind why it was simultaneously exhilarating and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Easiest decision of my career</title>

   <id>https://adilw3nomad.github.io/2022/04/25/easiest_decision_of_my_career</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-easiest-decision-of-my-career&quot;&gt;The easiest decision of my career&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;july-13th-2020-summer-of-covid&quot;&gt;July 13th 2020, Summer of Covid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey Adil.  Hope you‚Äôre doing great despite the bad news earlier. I wanted to point something out now that the process has come to a close with Cutover.   A contact of mine is in the internal team over at Hopin, a video events platform thats gone from 8 people to 80 people in the last 4 months (thanks to lockdown).  They‚Äôre looking for people with your skills, and I‚Äôm happy to make an intro if you would like me to?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the message sent to me by one of the best recruiters I‚Äôve worked with, Dale Player, after having lost a potential position at a company called Cutover for a more senior developer. At the time, I was pretty down about it, although the developer who interviewed me seemed to nervously laugh alot about the role mainly being upgrading to Angular 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had only used Angular briefly at a previous role, and something about the listlessness in his eyes told me that it would be a gruelling job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I naturally felt dejected by the rejection and so I jumped at this new oppourtunity offered to me by Dale. He put me in contact with a chap called Darren Tomlin, and on the 24th of July I found myself in a video interview with Nico Klein and Piotr Sarnacki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-this-real-life-or-is-it-a-fantasy&quot;&gt;Is this real life, or is it a fantasy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an interview unlike anything I had ever experienced. Nico peppered me with questions to assess my Ruby and Rails knowledge, which I stumbled through awkwardly before he hit me with the next question. It was blunt and to the point; he moved from one question to the next with dexterity, while readily giving feedback on my answers and proposing other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These alternatives are now what I know to be the objectively better way of going about things, however he never made me feel like I got the question wrong. He reminded me of a stern yet fair teacher, (ironic, since I later found out his passion for teaching Maths through a non-profit app!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piotr, the other interviewer, was quieter then Nico, letting him drive most of the questions. I noticed, however, warmth and encouragement in his eyes, even when I gave the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù answer to one of Nico‚Äôs questions. This warmth erupted into an inferno of excitement when he spoke of the cutting edge technologies they were planning on using at Hopin, the unique challenges and oppourtunities to be innovative; to use a lanaguage like Rust to create performant services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear Piotr talk about Rust was &lt;em&gt;electrifying&lt;/em&gt;. Now, to give you some context, I don‚Äôt really like Rust that much, but his passion was contaigious and palpable. I used to run a &lt;em&gt;Gust&lt;/em&gt; club at my previous job (what was meant to be a Golang coding club but everyone wanted to do Rust so we made a compromise), and I had a little idea of what made it so revolutionary. Listening to Piotr speak of using it in production, it gave me goosebumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this happened while we all sat in different rooms, in different houses, and I‚Äôm pretty sure different countries (Piotr was in Berlin at the time I think, and unless I‚Äôm mistaken, Nico wasn‚Äôt living in London at the time). Yet I felt like I was in the same room as them, something I remarked to my brother later on who replied,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWell at least you saved on the commute if they don‚Äôt take you on‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time in my career that I was interviewed by two distinctly different developers, who were actively trying to get me to show them my strengths; a stark contrast to my other experiences. Most tech interviews I had up until that point seemed to be a search for my inadequacies; reasons to say &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; or reasons to offer you a lower salary then you expected or were worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two chaps however, with a combined experience quadrupling my own, brought out my best qualities; my curiousity and enthusiasm, my lack of ego to my ideas or beliefs, a detachement to my code. Most of all, they saw my deep desire to grow, to work alongside passionate, empathetic and talented individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was by far the best interview I had ever had, so much so that I told Darren (foolishly, don‚Äôt do this kids) that I wanted this job so badly, I would be willing to take a salary that was lower then the advertised range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first taste of Hopin culture, and I was hooked like Tommy from trainspotting; intoxicated on a combination of admiration of the company and the pride I felt that I was even being considered to join it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;palms-sweaty-knees-weak-arms-are-heavy&quot;&gt;Palms sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5 days later, I get a call from Darren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Heya Adil, so here‚Äôs the deal mate, I couldn‚Äôt get you the salary you wanted unfortunately‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a matter of seconds, my heart sunk to the floor, then jumped back up when i realised there was still an offer coming, just a shittier one then I had hoped for. I audibily groan/sigh, as I start trying to figure out how low I would go to join this company. I just knew I had to be part of it, but man, living is expensive‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶but I did manage to get you 3k more then you wanted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swear to God I jumped around my house, flip flopping betwen  roaring with laughter and cursing out Darren for his perfectly executed prank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So do you want the job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easiest decision of my career; of course I want the bloody job!&lt;/p&gt;
