title: The Three Cs of Culture, part 1

I'll be frank; I don't like the word 'Culture'. Or at least its usage in the context of the tech industry. Its ambiguity is routinely abused by companies seeking to entice naive employees into their grasp. Sometimes they even have the gall to list *culture* under their 'Benefits and Compensation' section! As if a good and healthy working environment is an added benefit, rather than a given in any modern place of work.

What is *work culture* exactly? Some would have you believe that it consists of free coffee, a table tennis table, a beer fridge, and a biweekly day for you to 'work on personal projects'. I'm not going to say these are bad things, but they do not define a *work culture*. They are tangentially related to my personal definition of culture, compromised of the three **Cs**

1. Communication
2. Collaboration
3. Camaraderie

This post will focus on **Communication**, and I will tackle the next two Cs in separate posts. I must stress that these are only my own thoughts on the subject, and I welcome any challenges or alternate opinions.

### Communication

The first of the Cs, and arguably the foundation upon which the other two reside, is communication; how do people communicate with each other? In every group of people, a secondary form of *language* develops from the conversations people have every day. The longer a group of people interacts with each other, the more entrenched this *language* becomes. It influences every debate, meeting, and crucially, **decision** that takes place within the group.

[//]: # (Talk about affect on processes, e.g onboarding, etc)


It is, therefore, of immense importance that the development of this *language* is carefully observed and pruned in order to have the qualities of inclusivity, honesty, and freedom. If these qualities are present, then conversations are more likely to have a diverse range of *good* ideas. *Bad* ideas are quickly torn apart, as the *language* promotes honesty and the freedom to express that honesty.

"Well, that all sounds great Adil, but how on earth do we develop a *language*, when we're up to our neck simply developing our app?"

A fair point, my imaginary stressed out founder. As is often the case in start ups, there is a tremendous amount of focus on delivering; ideas must be validated, and validation comes from putting forth an MVP (the minimum viable product). For the sake of the MVP, many things are placed in the backlog; actions that are unequivocally vital for the *continued* success of any idea. Automated testing is eschewed in favour of manual QA, code is left inefficient and not performant, favouring paying out a larger infrastructure bill ***as long as the MVP works!***.

Some form of debt, technical or otherwise, is taken on willingly; a sacrifice for the MVP, the master of startup destinies. However, cultural debt is not as easily paid off; it's a lot easier to write an automated test then it is to change something as fluid and intangible as the way people communicate. Social norms tend to have a compounding effect as you add more people to the group; new joiners want to fit in, so they tend to behave in the same fashion as their colleagues. While it's not impossible to change this, it's an incredibly complex endeavour due to the nature of the problem; humans are unpredictable and normally averse to change.

While the *MVP* is the master of a startup's destiny, **Culture** controls it's continued success; it's effect on productivity, recruiting and **retention** of talent, and **promotion of innovative ideas** is practically undeniable. (I would add links to research papers that prove this, but I feel like if you've read this far, we're probably on the same page already. If we're not; try duckduckgo-ing `'effect of company culture at work research'` and see if that changes your mind ðŸ˜‰)

Therefore, while it may be acceptable to make some technical compromises in order to deliver an *MVP*, some minimal effort must be put towards creating a *minimum viable culture*. I would call it an *MVC*, but something tells me that acronym won't catch on. Forget about the name for the time being, naming stuff is hard. Let's just focus on what's the minimum we can do in order to ensure the *language* of our communication embodies the qualities of Inclusivity, Honesty, and Freedom.

In order to deliver this *MVP language* of communication, which will be the cornerstone of all communication within the company, and in turn the foundation of the company's culture, we must take a slight detour to understand how our brains work. 

### Compassion

Compassion is biologically coded into us. Evolutionary system; your brain is biologically designed to respond to signals of compassion; from the day we are born, we need to be careful, and we tend to trust the people who show us compassion
