I'll be frank; I don't like the word 'Culture' or at least its usage in the context of the tech industry. Its ambiguity is routinely abused by companies seeking to entice naive employees into their grasp. Sometimes they even have the gall to list *culture* under their 'Benefits and Compensation' section! As if a good and healthy working environment is an added benefit, rather than a given in any modern place of work.

What is *work culture* exactly? Some would have you believe that it consists of free coffee, a table tennis table, a beer fridge, and a biweekly day for you to 'work on personal projects'. I'm not going to say these are bad things, but they do not define a *work culture*. They are tangentially related to my personal definition of culture, compromised of the three **Cs**

2. Collaboration
3. Camaraderie

The first of the Cs, and arguably the foundation upon which the other two reside, is communication. How do people communicate with each other? In every group of people, whether in a company or not, a secondary form of *language* often develops from the conversations people have every day. The longer a group of people interacts with each other, the more entrenched this *language* becomes. It influences every debate, meeting, and crucially, **decision** that takes place within the group. 

It is, therefore, of immense importance that the development of this *language* is carefully observed and pruned in order to have the qualities that are conducive to inclusivity, honesty, and freedom. If these qualities are present, then the conversations are more likely to have a diverse range of *good* ideas. *Bad* ideas are quickly torn apart, as the *language* promotes honesty and the freedom to express that honesty. 

"Well, that all sounds great Adil, but how on earth do we develop a *language*, when we're up to our neck simply developing our app?"
